# Learned League Tool

## Background
Learned League is an invite only online trivia competition. Each season is 25 days long and occurs four times per year. The format includes answering six questions against an opponent, and assigning point values to each question. Whoever has a higher score after the six questions wins that day. https://www.learnedleague.com

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to allow a user to see questions from past seasons (back to season 60) and allows filtering of the questions based on category, and % of people who got the question correct (difficulty). The information and questions come directly from publically available information on the Learned League website.
